Hello Bixly!



Getting Started:

Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies:

npm install

.gitignore and .env files contain necessary secrets and id's

I've omitted .gitignore for testing


Running the server:

Nodemon app.js


Testing the server application:

localhost:3000/login

Please follow the "Sign in with Google" token login.

The following json payloads are accessible from /cars /boats /trucks

The /:id is by Make.

Making POST requests, PUT and DELETING are available through Postman.

Specifications:

The following application has a backend database in MongoDB. 
I've used Oath 2.0 from Google's API services for the authorization. 

I've disabled the login so please use the google button for testing purposes.
